This Project is going exam whether the Vaporflys launched by NIKE help Runner run faster.\
Several studies have reported dramatic speed improvements for
runners wearing these shoes. The objective of this study is to determine the magnitude of the
improvement and whether the improvement varies across (1) gender, (2) runner and (3) course.\

The data on the course website are from the [recent paper](https://www.researchers.one/article/2020-02-14)\

Other than this paper, I choose to use the Bayesian approach to exam this shoes. My project can be found [here](Vaporflys-by-bayesian.html)
